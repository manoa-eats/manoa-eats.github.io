# Team Contract
Manoa eats is a team consisting of 5 computer engineering and computer science students that have signed this [Team Contract](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-v9pqiJ7Q1Jij45WQcrJkHYzmSRQN-saOC0DPg8Gzvk/edit?usp=sharing) to follow a work criteria we all decided upon.

# Application Repo
Visit [github.com/manoa-eats/manoa-eats](https://github.com/manoa-eats/manoa-eats) to access our application repo

# Overview
Manoa Eats is a web application that will allow students and staff access to the different eateries information on campus. When they visit our landing page they will notice a search bar in the middle of the page and a collum of the left of the page giving he hours of various eateries. At the top of the page there will be several different tabs which include an All Restaurants tab and I'm Feeling Hungry tab. Once the user signs in or creates an account they will able to have access to a reviews tab.

### The Problem
Not many students know about all of our fine dish eateries on the UH Manoa campus. In addition, some students who want to try new restaurants may not get a chance to because they may have time conflicts with their schedule leaving some restaurants having either too many students in line or not enough students.

### The Solution
Manoa Eats will allow hardworking students to nourish their brains with UHâ€™s nutritious food located all around the campus. Students will be able to upload their schedules along with their course locations, and our website will estimate the best restaurant locations to stop at on their path to their next class.
